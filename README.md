# ChainLinksCodingExercise
Chain Link Game
The Links game is a two-player strategy game where the objective is to collect more points than the other player by taking links out of either end of a chain.
The game is played by taking turns to choose a link, with the player who collects the most valuable links winning.

In this project, I have used JavaFx as the front-end technology for building the user interface.
Additionally, the project also integrates with Spring Boot, to make it possible to play the game using API's(not implemented)
